    <h2>Cooking</h2>
  
  <p class = "p3"> 
    Since I first started studying abroad in the US, I had to learn to cook. Getting food from outisde was costly and unhealthy. I started learning from youtube videos until I mastered some recipes. I can now be cr eative in the kitchen and confident that my food will taste well.
